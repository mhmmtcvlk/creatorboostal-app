<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built the CreatorBoostal social media boost platform from scratch, iteratively implementing features based on a detailed product description and user feedback. Initial steps involved setting up the full-stack Expo (React Native) frontend with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, including authentication, VIP, boost, and notification systems. The engineer actively responded to user requests, like adding a rotating social media icon animation and updating the branding from CreatorBoosta to CreatorBoostal across the application. A significant portion of the recent interaction involved debugging and activating administrative features, such as the VIP management panel and price update functionality, demonstrating a strong ability to diagnose and fix issues related to API integration and frontend rendering. The development process showcased a clear understanding of mobile-first UI/UX principles and robust full-stack implementation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on fully activating the system, specifically addressing issues with Save and Purchase buttons not working. The current focus is on the VIP Admin Panel API, where the AI found that hardcoded API URLs in the frontend were preventing proper communication with the backend. The AI has just completed the first step of fixing the frontend API calls for the VIP admin panel, specifically in . It updated the  function to correctly use the  for API requests, ensuring that VIP package price and status updates are sent to the backend. The AI confirmed that the functions were implemented but the save buttons were still not functional, indicating that further work is needed to fully integrate the frontend actions with the backend API and ensure the entire system is active.
